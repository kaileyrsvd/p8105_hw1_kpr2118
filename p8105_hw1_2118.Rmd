The chunk below creates a dataframe containing a random sample of size 10 from a std normal distribution, a logical vector indicating if elements are GT 0, a character vector length 10, and a factor vector length 10 with 3 factor levels. The code chunk also finds the mean of each variable.

```{r problem 1}
library(tidyverse)

prob1_df = tibble(
  rand_samp = rnorm(10),
  rand_samp_pos = rand_samp > 0,
  vec_char = c("This", "is", "a", "character", "vector", "of", "length", "ten", "characters", "right"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("first", "second", "third", "first", "second", "third", "first", "second", "third", "first"))
)

prob1_df

mean_rand_samp = mean(pull(prob1_df, rand_samp))
mean_rand_samp_pos = mean(pull(prob1_df, rand_samp_pos))
mean_vec_char = mean(pull(prob1_df, vec_char))
mean_vec_factor = mean(pull(prob1_df, vec_factor))

mean_rand_samp
mean_rand_samp_pos
mean_vec_char
mean_vec_factor

#The numeric variables create means but the non-numeric variables return NA
```
